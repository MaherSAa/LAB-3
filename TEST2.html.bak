    <p id="HTML"> HTML 5 is the fifth and current major version of the HTML standard, and subsumes XHTML. 
	It currently exists in two standardized forms: HTML 5.2 Recommendation[4] by the World Wide 
	Web Consortium (W3C, a broad coalition of organizations), intended primarily for Web content developers; 
	and HTML Living Standard[5] by WHATWG (a small consortium of four browser vendors),
	intended primarily for browser developers, though it also exists in an abridged Web developer
	version [6] There are minor conflicts between the two groups' specifications..
